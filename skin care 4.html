            <h1>Skin Care </h1>
		<p>	Everybody wants to feel good about the way that they look, but it seems there is no shortage of ailments out there determined to tear down your self-esteem. Whether fighting acne, dandruff, or anything in between, society is engaged in an all-out beauty battle. While there is an endless array of products out there that target our insecurities, a lot of them don’t deliver the desired results. Rather than frantically searching for a miracle cure, make sure you’re not fretting too much over the little things (nobody else can see the red speck on the upper left corner of your nostril, truly) and be smart about the way you treat yourself. Resorting to unhealthy measures or chemical-laden creams isn’t always the best route to go. When all is said and done, being healthy is what gives you the ultimate glow.</p>
        
		<h2>Remove BlackHeads</h2>
		           <p><h3> 1.Baking Soda</h3>Baking soda is an effective treatment for blackheads as well as acne. It helps clear the skin of impurities such as debris and dirt.<br>-Mix two teaspoons of baking soda with mineral water to make a paste.<br>-Apply the paste generously on the affected skin area and massage gently. Allow it to dry for a few minutes before rinsing it off with warm water.<br>-Repeat this remedy once or twice a week.<p/>
         
		 <p><h3>2.Lemon</h3>ALemon juice, also used in acne treatment, can help remove blackheads. The nutrients and vitamins present in lemon juice are good for all skin types.
<br>-Put a few drops of honey on half a lemon. For extra exfoliation, you can also add a little sugar. Gently rub the lemon on your face, especially on the blackhead prone areas. Rinse it off after 10 minutes. Repeat once or twice a week.
<br>-You can also mix fresh lemon juice with milk or rosewater to create a facial cleanser and use a few times a week</p>	   		   
		   
            <p><h3>3.Cinnamon</h3>Cinnamon can be used to remove and prevent blackheads.
<br>-Mix one teaspoon each of cinnamon powder and lemon juice with a pinch of turmeric powder (optional). Spread it on your face, leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes and then rinse it off.
<br>-Alternatively, mix one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and honey to form a thick paste. Apply it on the affected area before bed and leave it on overnight. In the morning, wash your face well with normal water. For best results, follow this remedy daily for about 10 days.</p>

		   <p><h3>4.Oatmeal</h3>The combination of oatmeal and yogurt is great for keeping your skin free of blackheads.
<br>-Mix one teaspoon honey and the juice of four tomatoes in sufficient oatmeal to make a paste.<br>-Scrub it on your skin.<br>Wash it off after 10 minutes.Repeat regularly for clear skin.</p>
		 
		 <p><h3>5.Green Tea</h3>Green tea can also be used to treat blackheads.<br>-Mix one teaspoon of dry green tea leaves with a little water to make a paste.
<br>-Gently scrub the paste over the affected area for two to three minutes. This scrub deep cleans oily skin and helps unclog pores.<br>-Rinse your face with lukewarm water.</p>

		<p><h3>6.Turmeric</h3>Turmeric, which works well for minor burns, can also be used to treat blackheads.
<br>-Mix some turmeric powder with two tablespoons of mint juice. Apply it to the affected areas. Allow it to dry for a few minutes and then wash the area with lukewarm water.
<br>-You can also make a thick paste by mixing red sandalwood, turmeric powder and milk together. Apply it on the affected area and after 10 minutes wash the skin with water.
</p>

		  <p><h3>7.Honey</h3>The balancing quality present in honey is good for both oily skin and blackheads. Honey hydrates as well as tightens the skin pores, giving you a clear complexion.<br>-Apply some pure honey on your face. Leave it on for about 10 minutes.
<br>-Rinse your face with lukewarm water.</p>
