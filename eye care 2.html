            <h1>Eye Care </h1>
		<p> Many people suffer from poor eyesight, distorted vision, or have difficulty seeing objects close up (farsightedness or hyperopia) or at a distance (nearsightedness or myopia). Taking proper care of your eyes, including providing the nutrients they need, plays a vital role in keeping them healthy.
The overall health of your eyes depends on certain nutrients, such as vitamins A and C, bioflavonoids, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals and antioxidants.
Eating certain superfoods can keep your eyes functioning at their best for a longer period of time, as well as help prevent various eye problems.</p>
        
		<h2>Get Rid From Itchy Eyes</h2>
		           <p><h3> 1.Cold Compress</h3>Applying cold compresses around the affected eye area can help you to get instant relief. The simplest way to do this is to soak a cloth in ice cold water and place it over your eyes. Do this several times a day.
Chamomile tea bags used as cold compresses can also help relieve itching eyes.
<br>-Put used chamomile tea bags in the refrigerator for half an hour.<br>-Place the chilled tea bags over the affected eye(s) for at least 10 minutes.<br>-Do this three to four times a day for fast recovery.</p>

            <p><h3>3. Cold Milk</h3>Milk is also one of the popular home remedies for itchy eyes.<br>-Dab a cotton ball in cold milk and rub it around the eyes.
