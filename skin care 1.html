            <h1>Skin Care </h1>
		<p>	Everybody wants to feel good about the way that they look, but it seems there is no shortage of ailments out there determined to tear down your self-esteem. Whether fighting acne, dandruff, or anything in between, society is engaged in an all-out beauty battle. While there is an endless array of products out there that target our insecurities, a lot of them don’t deliver the desired results. Rather than frantically searching for a miracle cure, make sure you’re not fretting too much over the little things (nobody else can see the red speck on the upper left corner of your nostril, truly) and be smart about the way you treat yourself. Resorting to unhealthy measures or chemical-laden creams isn’t always the best route to go. When all is said and done, being healthy is what gives you the ultimate glow.</p>
