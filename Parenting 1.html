            <h1>Parenting  </h1>
		<p> Many of us follow a strict beauty regimen to keep our skin, hair and nails in good health. In fact, people all over the world spend millions of dollars to enjoy beautiful skin, superb hair and strong nails.

When it comes to beauty, importance should be given to natural ingredients rather than commercial beauty products. Chemicals and toxins in commercial products can do a lot of harm in the long run.

There are many natural ingredients in your kitchen that shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
        
		<h2>Make Your Hair Grow Faster</h2>
		           <p><h3> 1.Use castor oil</h3>Being rich in vitamin E and essential fatty acids, especially omega-9 fatty acids, castor oil promotes hair growth naturally.
<br>-As this oil is quite viscous, mix the castor oil with an equal amount of coconut, olive, or almond oil. Massage your scalp with it and leave it on for 30 to 45 minutes. Then shampoo your hair.
<br>-You can also add essential oils, especially rosemary, peppermint, eucalyptus, lavender, or thyme oil, to the castor oil and then put it in your hair.</p>
  
           <p><h3>2.Massage your scalp</h3>Turmeric is an excellent antiseptic and skin-lightening agent that helps minimize scars and other marks. Plus, turmeric can alleviate allergic, inflammatory and infectious skin disorders that make your skin look dull and lifeless.
<br>-Apply the oil (preferably warm) or conditioner to your hair.<br>-Gently rub your fingers on your scalp in a circular motion for three to five minutes.
<br>-Rinse the oil or conditioner out of your hair.<p>
		   		   
		   
            <p><h3>3.Stay stress-free</h3>Stress is one of the most important factors that contribute to hair loss. It is believed that stress can disrupt the normal hair cycle and trigger hairs to enter the telogen or fall-out phase. Thus, when striving for faster hair growth, minimize the stress in your life.
To manage stress, you can use meditation, breathing exercises, or other relaxation techniques. Plus, be sure to get your beauty sleep as the growth hormone is released during sleep.</p>
           

		   <p><h3>4. Aloe Vera</h3>Aloe vera encourages hair growth and prevents hair loss. It also reduces dandruff and helps restore your hair’s natural sheen.
<br>-Extract the gel from an aloe vera leaf.
<br>-Apply fresh aloe vera gel mixed with a little lemon juice and leave it on for about 20 minutes. Shampoo your hair. Do this once every week or two.
<br>-You can also combine aloe vera gel with equal amounts of coconut milk and wheat germ oil and then apply it on your hair.
<br>-Drink aloe vera juice on a regular basis.</p>
		 


		 <p><h3>5.Eat a healthy diet</h3>Eating a diet rich in protein and vital vitamins and minerals is an essential prerequisite to healthy hair growth. Opt for foods high in vitamins A, B, C, and E, iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, and selenium. Vitamin B-complex, in particular, is extremely important for making your hair grow faster.
So, include a variety of foods like milk, cheese, yogurt, chicken, eggs, whole grains, salmon, spinach, broccoli, bell peppers, cabbage, parsley, grapefruit, avocado, brown bread, oats, and alfalfa in your diet to nourish your hair and scalp. Plus, drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices, such as orange, grapefruit, carrot, beet, and lettuce juice.
Fish, flax seeds, walnuts, beans, winter squash, olive oil, and other foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids are also good for hair growth as about 3% of a hair shaft is made up of omega-3 fatty acids.
Avoid nutritional deficiencies because they tend to affect your hair adversely. For example, vitamin E and zinc deficiencies lead to hair thinning and loss.</p>		

		<p><h3>6.Flip your hair upside down</h3>This is one of the most popular tricks to promote faster hair growth. Just flip your hair upside down by flipping your head over for two to four minutes daily. It is believed to work by improving circulation.<p>

		  <p><h3>7.Whip up an egg mask</h3>Eggs are highly beneficial for faster hair growth because they are packed with protein and also contain iron, sulfur, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. You can use an egg hair mask at least once a month.
<br>-Whisk an egg. Mix in four tablespoons of grapeseed oil and a few drops of lavender oil. Apply it on your hair and scalp and leave it on for half an hour. Finally, rinse it out and shampoo your hair as usual.
<br>-Apply a mixture of two egg yolks and two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil on your scalp. Leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes. Wash it out with cold water and then shampoo your hair.
<br>-Alternatively, whisk an egg and add one cup of milk, two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, and the juice from half a lemon to it. Apply it on your scalp and leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes before washing it out and shampooing your hair.</p>
