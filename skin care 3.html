            <h1>Skin Care </h1>
		<p>	Everybody wants to feel good about the way that they look, but it seems there is no shortage of ailments out there determined to tear down your self-esteem. Whether fighting acne, dandruff, or anything in between, society is engaged in an all-out beauty battle. While there is an endless array of products out there that target our insecurities, a lot of them don’t deliver the desired results. Rather than frantically searching for a miracle cure, make sure you’re not fretting too much over the little things (nobody else can see the red speck on the upper left corner of your nostril, truly) and be smart about the way you treat yourself. Resorting to unhealthy measures or chemical-laden creams isn’t always the best route to go. When all is said and done, being healthy is what gives you the ultimate glow.</p>
        
		<h2>Remove Acne </h2>
		           <p><h3> 1. Ice</h3>Ice can be used to quickly reduce the redness, swelling and inflammation of pimples. It helps in improving blood circulation to the affected area, and in tightening the skin pores and removing dirt and oil accumulated on the skin. You can use ice cubes or crushed ice, whichever is convenient.<br>-Wrap the ice in a piece of cloth and hold it on the affected skin area for a few seconds<br>-Wait a few minutes and repeat the process.<p/>
         
		 <p><h3>2.Lemon</h3>Another quick way to get rid of pimples is the use of lemon juice, which is rich in vitamin C. Lemon juice helps pimples dry up faster. Be sure to use fresh lemon juice and not bottled juice, which has preservatives. There are a couple of ways to apply this remedy.
<br>Dip a clean cotton swab in fresh lemon juice and apply it to the pimples before going to bed.
<br>You can also mix one tablespoon of lemon juice with one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and put it on the pimples overnight. In the morning, wash the skin well with lukewarm water. However, this particular remedy is not suitable for those with sensitive skin.</p>	   		   
		   
            <p><h3>3. Toothpaste</h3>The toothpaste that you use every morning to clean your teeth also can be used to treat pimples quickly. It is most effective when used following the ice remedy. You must use white toothpaste; avoid using gel toothpaste.
<br>-Apply some white toothpaste over the affected skin area before going to bed..
<br>-In the morning, wash your face with water and you will see a significant improvement in the swelling.
<br>-If you wish, you can repeat the process in the daytime also. Just make sure the toothpaste remains on the pimples for at least half an hour.</p>

		   <p><h3>4.Steam</h3>Steaming is wonderful for your skin at any time, but particularly when you have pimples. The steam will open your pores and allow your skin to breathe. This helps get rid of oils, dirt and bacteria trapped in the pores that can cause infection or inflammation.
<br>-Fill a large container with hot water and allow the steam to come in contact with your face for a few minutes.<br>-Rinse your face with lukewarm water and, after drying, apply an oil-free moisturizer.</p>
		 
		 <p><h3>5. Cucumber</h3>Cucumber is a rich source of potassium and vitamins such as A, C and E. It also has a cooling and soothing effect on the skin.<br>-Cut one or two fresh cucumbers into pieces and soak them in water for about an hour. The nutrients, such as vitamin A, potassium and chlorophyll will transfer to the water.
<br>-Strain the water and drink it, or use the water to wash your face.</p>

		<p><h3>6.Papaya</h3>Papaya fruit has a number of properties that help in the treatment of pimples. It is a good source of the antioxidant vitamin A, and it has enzymes that help reduce inflammation and make your skin soft and smooth.
<br>-Crush raw papaya pieces to extract its juice and apply it over the pimples. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes before rinsing it off.
<br>-To make a exfoliating face mask, mash some papaya pieces and add a little honey. Apply this paste on your face and massage gently. Leave it on until it dries completely and then rinse it off.
</p>

		  <p><h3>7.Honey</h3>Honey is a source of natural antibiotics that can speed up the healing process, as well as help prevent infections.<br>-Dip a clean cotton swab in honey, put it directly on the affected area and leave it on for half an hour.
<br>-Wash the skin well with lukewarm water.
<br>-Do this a few times a day.
<br>Another option is to mix honey and cinnamon together to make a paste and applying it over the pimples before going to bed. In the morning, there will be less inflammation or swelling. Wash the skin well with cold water.</p>
