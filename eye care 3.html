            <h1>Eye Care </h1>
		<p> Many people suffer from poor eyesight, distorted vision, or have difficulty seeing objects close up (farsightedness or hyperopia) or at a distance (nearsightedness or myopia). Taking proper care of your eyes, including providing the nutrients they need, plays a vital role in keeping them healthy.
The overall health of your eyes depends on certain nutrients, such as vitamins A and C, bioflavonoids, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals and antioxidants.
Eating certain superfoods can keep your eyes functioning at their best for a longer period of time, as well as help prevent various eye problems.</p>

		   <p><h3>4.Eyelid Massage</h3>Massaging your eyelids promotes the growth of your eyelashes. It improves blood flow to the hair follicles, which means more nutrients reach the follicles.
