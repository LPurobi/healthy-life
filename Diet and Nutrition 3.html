		<h2> Get Rid off Dry Hair</h2>
		           <p><h3> 1.Mayonnaise</h3>Mayonnaise is an excellent ingredient for treating dry hair at home. It contains lots of protein that will help make your hair soft and shiny.
<br>-Measure out one cup of full-fat mayonnaise. Apply a thick layer of it on slightly damp hair and scalp.
<br>-Massage the mayonnaise into your scalp and then work it through your hair to the ends.<br>-Cover your hair and head with a plastic cap for about an hour.<br>-Rinse your hair thoroughly with lukewarm water and then shampoo as usual.
Repeat weekly to hydrate very dry hair.</p>
  
           <p><h3>2.Eggs</h3>Eggs are also very helpful for dry and damaged hair. A good source of protein and lecithin, eggs help strengthen and repair damaged and lifeless hair by adding moisture, shine, and texture to it.
<br>-Whip an egg white thoroughly along with two tablespoons of lukewarm water. Apply the mixture to your damp hair and scalp and massage with your fingertips in a circular motion for 15 minutes. Then shampoo your hair with cool water. Do this once or twice a week, depending on the condition of your hair.<br>-Mix together three eggs, two tablespoons of olive oil and one tablespoon of honey. Apply this mixture to damp hair and scalp. Cover your head with a shower cap for about 30 minutes, and then wash your hair with a mild shampoo and cool water. Do this once a week to make your hair soft and silky.
<p>
		   		   
		   
            <p><h3>3.Beer</h3>Beer works as an excellent hair conditioner. The protein in beer helps repair damaged hair cuticles and nourish hair follicles, which in turn makes your hair shiny and smooth.
<br>-Shampoo your hair as usual and then spray a small amount of beer onto your hair. Allow your hair to dry on its own. When it is dry, your hair will look smooth and shiny.<br>-You can also spray beer onto your hair before blow drying or styling your hair.</p>
           

		   <p><h3>4.Olive Oil</h3>Olive oil is the most popular home remedy for dry hair. The rich vitamin E and antioxidant content present in olive oil help heal damaged hair by sealing the cuticle, or outer layer, with moisture. Olive oil can be used as a hot oil hair treatment to strengthen, add shine and restore moisture to very dry hair.
<br>-Put enough olive oil for the length of your hair in a cup or bowl and slightly warm it in a microwave.
<br>-Apply the warm oil thoroughly over your scalp and hair shafts. Massage your scalp gently for five to 10 minutes
<br>-Cover your hair with a warm towel and leave the oil on overnight, or at least for 30 minutes.
<br>-Finally, shampoo and condition your hair with products suited to your hair type.
Do this at least once a week to give your hair much-needed nourishment and care.
<p>
		 


		 <p><h3>5. Bananas</h3>Bananas are another excellent ingredient for treating extremely dry and damaged hair. The high potassium and moisture content in bananas prevents split ends, and softens and improves the elasticity of your hair.
<br>-Mash one ripe or overripe banana and spread it thoroughly on your hair, from the roots to the ends. Leave it on for up to an hour and then rinse your hair with lukewarm water. Do this once a week for effective results.<br>-Alternatively, mix one ripe or overripe banana, one tablespoon of almond oil and two tablespoons of honey. Apply this hair mask on your hair thoroughly. Leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes and then rinse well with lukewarm water. Follow this remedy once week to enjoy smooth and shiny hair.
</p>		

		<p><h3>6.Aloe Vera</h3>The unique combination of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids in aloe vera can greatly benefit dry and damaged hair.<br>-Mix one-half cup of aloe vera gel, two teaspoons each of castor oil and powdered fenugreek, and one teaspoon of basil powder. Mix the ingredients well and apply the mixture thoroughly onto your scalp and hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap and leave it on overnight. In the morning, wash your hair with a mild shampoo. Do this at least once a week to see good results within a month or two.<br>-Alternatively, add two teaspoons of thick hibiscus flower paste to one-half cup of aloe vera gel. Blend the ingredients well and your homemade conditioner is ready to use. Regular use of this conditioner will give a shine and soft texture to your dry hair.</p>
