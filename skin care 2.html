            <h1>Skin Care </h1>
		<p>	Everybody wants to feel good about the way that they look, but it seems there is no shortage of ailments out there determined to tear down your self-esteem. Whether fighting acne, dandruff, or anything in between, society is engaged in an all-out beauty battle. While there is an endless array of products out there that target our insecurities, a lot of them don’t deliver the desired results. Rather than frantically searching for a miracle cure, make sure you’re not fretting too much over the little things (nobody else can see the red speck on the upper left corner of your nostril, truly) and be smart about the way you treat yourself. Resorting to unhealthy measures or chemical-laden creams isn’t always the best route to go. When all is said and done, being healthy is what gives you the ultimate glow.</p>
        
		<h2>Remove Dark Circle</h2>
		           <p><h3> 1. Almond Oil</h3>Almond oil is a great natural ingredient that is very beneficial for the delicate skin around your eyes.

In addition to almond oil, you can use vitamin E oil to eliminate dark circles under the eyes.<br>-Before going to bed, apply a little almond oil over the dark circles and gently massage it into the skin.
<br>-Leave it on overnight.<br>-The next morning, wash it off with cold water.

		 <p><h3>2.  Raw Potato</h3>There are natural bleaching agents present in potato that can help lighten dark circles and get rid of puffiness around the eyes.<br>-Grate one or two raw potatoes to extract the juice. Soak a cotton ball in the juice and place it over your closed eyes. Make sure the juice covers the dark circles under your eyes as well as the eyelids. Allow the juice to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse your eyelids well with cool water. Repeat once or twice daily for a few weeks.
<br>-Instead of potato juice, you can also use thick potato slices to remove dark circles</p>	   		   
		   
            <p><h3>3.Rose Water</h3>Rose water has incredible ingredient for skin care. It rejuvenates the skin and has a soothing effect on tired eyes. Due to its mild astringent properties, it also works as a good skin toner.

<br>-Soak cotton eye pads in pure rose water for a few minutes.
<br>-Put the soaked pads on your closed eyelids.
<br>-Leave them on for about 15 minutes.
<br>-Follow this remedy twice daily for a few weeks.</p>

		   <p><h3>4.Tomato</h3>Tomatoes have bleaching properties that can lighten skin to a great extent.
<br>-Mix one teaspoon of tomato juice with one-half teaspoon of lemon juice. Gently apply this mixture on the dark circles and allow it to sit for 10 minutes. Rinse it off with water. Follow this remedy twice a day for a few weeks. Simply using tomato juice will also work.
<br>-You can also drink a glass of tomato juice with some mint leaves, lemon juice and salt. For maximum results, be sure to drink this juice immediately after making it. Drink it once or twice a day for about a week.</p>
		 


		 <p><h3>5. Cucumber</h3>Cucumbers have skin-lightening and mild astringent properties that help fix those raccoon eyes naturally. Plus, they have a soothing and refreshing effect.<br>-Cut a fresh cucumber into thick slices and chill them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Put the slices onto the affected skin area for about 10 minutes. Wash the area with water. Repeat twice daily for about a week or more.
<br>-Another option is to mix cucumber juice with lemon juice in equal amounts. Use a cotton ball to apply the mixture on the affected skin. Leave it on for 15 minutes and then wash it off with water. Follow this remedy daily for at least one week.</p>

		<p><h3>6. Coconut Oil</h3>Massaging with coconut oil is another effective natural remedy to lighten dark circles. Due to its moisturizing quality, coconut oil also promotes smooth skin and prevents wrinkles and fine lines under eyes.
<br>-Simply massage some extra-virgin coconut oil on the under eye area.
<br>-Leave it on for a few hours, and then wash it off.
<br>-Repeat two to three times daily for a few months or until you are satisfied with the results<p>

		  <p><h3>7.Tea Bags</h3>The caffeine and antioxidants present in tea can be highly beneficial for getting rid of dark circles as well as puffiness under eyes by shrinking the blood vessels and reducing fluid retention. The tannins, in particular, help decrease swelling and discoloration.
<br>-Chill two used green or black tea bags in the refrigerator for about half an hour.
<br>-Place one tea bag over each eye and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes.
<br>-Remove the tea bags and wash your face.
<br>-Repeat once or twice daily for a few weeks.
<br>Note: Be careful not to get the tea in your eyes.</p>

 <p><h3>Additional Tips</h3>
<br>1.Avoid rubbing your eyes too much or too often as it causes the blood vessels to dilate, thus making the under eye circles appear darker.
<br>2.Remove your make-up before going to sleep or else it may irritate your eyes.
<br>3.Limit sun exposure.
<br>4.Drink plenty of water throughout the day to get rid of water retention that could be causing the problem.
<br>5.To avoid eye bags caused by pooling of fluids in your lower eyelids, elevate your head by adding two or more pillows under your head before going to sleep.
<br>6.Pay attention to your diet and eat foods rich in vitamins A, C and E.
<br>7.Stop smoking and restrict alcohol and caffeine consumption; smoking damages skin cells, and alcohol and caffeine contribute to dehydration which in turn weakens the delicate skin around the eyes
<br>8.Get adequate sleep and rest.</p>
